# Remote-Control-Application

This project is a remote-control application that allows a single user to remote-control through the network several machines (the slaves) by using just one personal computer (the master).

The master can connect to the slaves and control mouse and keyboard. In addition, the user can easily copy a file from any machine and paste it into another one, simply using the windowsâ€™ Copy/Cut/Past\
e functionalities.

The software runs on Windows (on top of the .NET framework) and is written in C#. The graphical User Interface has been developed by using windows form.
